I'm not sure if any of y'all had seen the core reasons behind why I wanted to create this .   in the beginning it was just an idea I didn't even think would become anything .  it sounded dumb the more I thought about it but I went for it and tested the waters anyways .   the entire reason I wanted to create something was to give to the homeless and less fortunate .   I wanted to build more than an app .   a community almost of people who were willing and wanting to help others and who obviously knew computers and crypto and stocks to help make that possible .   people who were willing to walk around and go hand out money after meeting and hearing stories of these homeless in their communities.     I wanted an app that just utilized crypto and stocks and blockchains to maximize profits and be able to put that money into accounts and have those accounts attached to debit cards that people could just go hand out.   I'm not even sure what to think I didn't think anyone would notice a small GitHub posting and take it to where it is now .     I had chat after chat with gpt and there's so much more behind. what I saw and I will be willing to give access to those wanting to see the full reasons and here behind the whole idea because that is inportant .   this was never a get rich quick scheme or even a simple charity idea .  it was complex and real and has come along so beautifully .  I feel I owe a lot of people many thanks and much more for all the help and guidance.  I've just been overwhelmed with the phone going off non stop I haven't had time to actually look into what's been happening properly and I apologize for that .  

kind regards
